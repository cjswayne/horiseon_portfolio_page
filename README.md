# horiseon_portfolio_page

## Description

The motivation for this project was to refactor a landing page for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc., to better optimize their page for Search engine optimization. 
The problems this project solves are better semantically formatting the html document to have better a better SEO score, and to consolidate css for better readibility and to reduce code "wetness". Things I learned from this project contain organizing CSS files to better fit the flow of the HTML document, and how to semantically format an exisiting HTML document.
